### Who the course is for

Ph.D student, postdocs and scientists who are interested in executing model simulations and learning more about technical aspects around it.

We can accept a maximum of 30 students based on their knowledge of using HPC machines.

### What we will not teach

This is not a course for advanced NorESM users.

### Course goals

The aim of this course is to demonstrate to the workshop
participants on the workflow to run the NorESM2 and diagnose its output
with the online documentations.

Also introduce the best practices and tools to contribute the development of documentation and code of NorESM
